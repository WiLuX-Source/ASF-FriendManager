# ASF-FriendManager

ArchiSteamFarm plugin that allows you to manage friends easily.
## How To Install
1. Go to [**Releases.**](https://github.com/WiLuX-Source/ASF-FriendManager/releases)
2. Find the **latest version**
3. **Download** the zip file.
4. Extract it to **root folder of ASF.**
5. Check plugins tab to see if it worked or not.

Enjoy!

## How to use
By default when you install this mod if you send any of your running bots a friend request they accept it automatically this behavior applies to all of the bots you have.

However I also made 2 commands for convenience as well.

- `addfriend [botname] [botnames]` - Adds a bot to friend list.
- `delfriend [botname] [botnames]` - Removes a bot from friend list.

## Planned
These are things I plan to add for now...
- [ ] IPC Api
- [ ] Setting for accepting any friend request.
