# ASF-FriendManager

ArchiSteamFarm plugin that allows you to manage friends easily.
## How To Install
1. Go to [**Releases.**](https://github.com/WiLuX-Source/ASF-FriendManager/releases)
2. Find the **latest version**
3. **Download** the zip file.
4. Extract it to **root folder of ASF.**
5. Check plugins tab to see if it worked or not.

Enjoy!

## How to use
ASF accepts from any friend request made from master but not from other bots unless they have special role in `EAccess`. When you install this mod it passively accepts friend request(s) from all of your bots.

However I also made 2 commands for convenience as well.

- `addfriend [botname] [botnames | STEAMIDS]` - Adds a bot(s)/user(s) to friend list.
- `remfriend [botname] [botnames | STEAMIDS]` - Removes a user(s) from friend list.

## Planned
These are things I plan to add for now...
- [x] IPC Api
- [ ] Utilites.Inparallel
- [ ] StringBuilder Alternative
- [ ] Setting for accepting any friend request.
